# fedoraPackageMon
Automated installer for new fedora builds customized to individual package needs. This tool can be used to install a specific set of packages and build that suits personal needs of a fedora workstation user.
To Explore further run the tool ./runPackageMon as root. It depends on dnf to manage most of installs except for those packages that have complex and custom install steps. Also wine packages are handled
seperately since they need to be interactive while installing them.
